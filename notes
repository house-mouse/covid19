Python and jupyter seem to have falled in to complete suck.

No combination of things go jupyter lab to work on mac or linux mint.
Suck.

Hard core suckage:

#sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook

sudo docker run -p 10000:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan/work jupyter/scipy-notebook
